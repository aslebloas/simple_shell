.SH SYNOPSIS
Simple shell is a simple version of a Unix shell. A prompt is displayed and will continue to be displayed everytime a command is executed. The shell reads executables from the PATH environment variable and can also handle the built-in functions 'env' and 'exit'.

    Non-interactive mode: ./hsh [command_string | file]

    Interactive-mode: [command_string]

.SH DESCRIPTION
HSH is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read
from the standard input or from a file.

.SH INVOCATION
An interactive shell is one started without arguments.
PS1 is set to #cisfun$.
You can also pipe commands to the ./hsh exectuable file. This is the non-interactive
mode.

.B Simple Commands
A simple command is a sequence of optional variable assignments followed by blank
separated words and redirections, and terminated by a control operator. The first
word specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as an argment zero. The
remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
